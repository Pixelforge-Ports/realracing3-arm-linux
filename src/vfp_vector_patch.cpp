/*
 * VFP short-vector compatibility for the Real Racing 3 audio mixer.
 *
 * Register decoding and scalar code generation are adapted from VFPVector by
 * Bythos, commit d95ba13 ("Fix mis-identification of VABS and VSQRT"), MIT.
 * The original library traps unsupported instructions on PlayStation Vita and
 * patches them lazily. Linux/ARM cannot use that mechanism: Cortex-A35 accepts
 * the same opcodes but treats FPSCR LEN/STRIDE as RAZ/WI, silently executing
 * only lane zero. This pinned game binary is therefore patched eagerly.
 *
 * Only the F32 operations present in the measured vector regions are decoded
 * (VMOV/VADD/VSUB/VMUL/VMLA). Every source opcode is checked before it is
 * touched, and the whole list is verified register-for-register by the
 * self-test below - see analysis/vfp_discover.py for how it was derived.

/*
 * Extracted from the pinned MEI v1.0.58 binary by analysis/vfp_discover.py:
 * every arithmetic instruction inside the 8 FPSCR LEN setup/reset pairs. All
 * 29 live in EA::Audio::Core - the Xas1 decoder, the delay/all-pass filters,
 * and the gain mixers.
 *
 * The lanes/stride columns come from the FPSCR value the game itself ORs in
 * before each region, and this binary uses only two: 0x30000 (LEN=3, STRIDE=0
 * -> 4 lanes, step 1) around Xas1Dec::DecodeChannel, and 0x70000 (LEN=7,
 * STRIDE=0 -> 8 lanes, step 1) everywhere else. Those are exactly the two
 * values a sibling port uses, whose audio is correct on this hardware - there is no
 * STRIDE=2 anywhere in either game.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this table claimed 2/6 lanes and a STRIDE=2 region.
 * That was an artefact of vfp_discover.py reading objdump's decimal immediate
 * as hexadecimal (196608 -> 0x196608), not something in the binary, and it is
 * what made the mixer sound wrong: the 8-lane regions computed 6 of every 8
 * samples and left the other two as whatever the registers last held, which is
 * the constant 768/1024 non-zero ratio the device log reported. analysis/
 * vfp_coverage.py now checks these two columns against the binary so a script
 * artefact cannot reach the audio again.
 *
 * The 0x7e... encodings are conditionally-executed vector ops (vaddvc/vmulvc/
 * vmlavc); the condition the reaching branch already carries, so the expansion
 * runs them unconditionally.
