/*
 * Binary patches applied to libMassEffect.so after relocation.
 *
 * Ported from so_patch() in the Vita loader (vita-ref/loader/patch.c, MIT).
 * The offsets are safe to reuse verbatim because it is byte-for-byte the same
 * library - sha1 ea58b733d3d267ab639431b50539542faa43f0d0, which the harness
 * re-checks on every run before it starts anything.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What these three words actually do, verified against the disassembly rather
 * than taken on faith from the reference:
 *
 * The engine has two ways to read an asset. One opens a file descriptor and
 * uses read/lseek. The other goes back out through JNI - MainActivity.
 * GetInstance().getAssets(), then AssetManager.open() returning a
 * java.io.InputStream it reads through. Which one it uses is decided per path
 * by a prefix test against the string "appbundle:/", and the result is cached
 * in a per-stream flag at object offset 0xa4.
 *
 *   0x0022bf24  the prefix test, one of two identical copies:
 *      22bf28  ldr   ip, [pc, #516]     ; GOT base   -> 0x0043e8d0
 *      22bf2c  ldr   lr, [pc, #516]     ; GOT offset -> -0x64800
 *      22bf4c  add   r3, ip, lr         ; = 0x003da0d0, the literal
 *                                       ;   "appbundle:/" in .rodata
 *      22bf50  strlen loop over it
 *      22bf64  bl    0x22a8d0           ; compare(path, len)
 *      22bf68  subs  r8, r0, #0
 *      22bf6c  bne   0x22bf90           ; taken = "not an appbundle path"
 *      22bf70  mov   r3, #1
 *      22bf74  str   r3, [r4, #0xa4]    ; taken = "use the JNI reader"
 *
 *   0x0022b200  the reader, dispatching on that flag:
 *      22b204  ldr   r3, [r0, #0xa4]
 *      22b210  cmp   r3, #1
 *      22b214  beq   0x22b270           ; -> the JNI path
 *      22b218  ldr   r0, [r0, #16]      ; -> the fd path
 *      22b22c  bl    lseek@plt
 *
 * Turning the two `bne` into an unconditional `b` with the same displacement
 * makes the prefix test look permanently failed, so the 0xa4 flag is never
 * set; NOPing the `beq` makes the reader ignore the flag even if something
 * else sets it. Both halves are needed - the flag is written from more places
 * than the two patched here, and the reference patches both for that reason.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What these patches did NOT fix, corrected.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed they were the fix for a SIGSEGV
 * at pc = 0 that the run log showed alongside
 *
 *   FindClass: no fake class registered for 'com/ea/blast/MainActivity'
 *   GetStaticMethodID ... 'GetInstance' -> NULL
 *   GetMethodID ... 'getAssets' -> NULL
 *
 * That was wrong, and it was measured to be wrong twice. The crash was an
 * unthunked gettimeofday overflowing a bionic struct timeval on the stack (see
 * src/symtab_time.cpp); with these three patches applied and that thunk absent
 * the crash is bit-identical, and with the thunk present and so_patch_binary()
 * disabled the run reaches the same milestone. The fake classes were not the
 * cause either - jni.cpp null-checks every Call*Method, so a NULL jmethodID
 * returns 0 rather than jumping to it.
 *
 * What they actually buy is visible one milestone later, and it is not
 * cosmetic. With the JNI reader out of the way the engine opens its data with
 * open(), and the first thing the strace shows once it starts loading is
 *
 *   openat(AT_FDCWD, "appbundle:/EAMCore.ini", O_RDONLY)
 *
 * i.e. a real syscall this port can answer, which src/symtab_io.cpp then
 * redirects into the mounted tree. Without these patches that same read goes
 * back out through AssetManager.open() and would need a fake MainActivity, a
 * fake java.io.InputStream over a real FILE*, and a fake AssetFileDescriptor -
 * a few hundred lines of Java emulation whose entire job would be to hand the
 * engine bytes off a filesystem it can already read itself. That is why the
 * Vita port does it this way, and why these stay.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is a fourth patch in the reference, a hook at 0x00320624 that delays a
 * thread which otherwise corrupts memory and faults somewhere different every
 * run. Deliberately not applied: it is a fix for a symptom we have not
 * observed, it would sit between us and the first non-deterministic crash we
 * do see, and applying it now would mean never learning whether this loader
 * needs it. If a crash starts moving around between runs, that is where to
 * look.
