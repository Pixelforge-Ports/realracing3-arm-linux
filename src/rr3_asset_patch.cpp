/*
 * Asset-accounting patch: stop RR3 from concluding that half a gigabyte of
 * assets is missing.
 *
 * What was measured, over the 21 startup asset lists and the donor tree:
 *
 *     entries in the lists                       12702
 *     present, md5 matching the install cache     5615
 *     considered missing                          7087  (548 124 892 bytes)
 *       of those, .dxt.dds / .atc.dds / .ptc.pvr  7056
 *       genuinely absent non-textures               31
 *
 * 99.6% of the "missing" bytes are texture variants for GPUs that are not this
 * one - Tegra, Adreno and PowerVR encodings that the donor never contained
 * because the Android build downloads only the family its GPU wants. Mali/ETC1
 * is complete.
 *
 * The engine already has the filter for that. CC_AssetManager_Class::
 * LoadAssetList (0x94f374) asks its agent SkipAsset() per entry through
 * vtable+8 (the call at 0x94f57a) before counting it, and
 * AssetDownloadService::SkipAssetImpl (0x322d9c) is
 *
 *     isTextureFilename(name) && !isPrimaryFilename(name)   -> skip
 *
 * In this port that filter is inert: mtTextureManager::isPrimaryFilename
 * (0x81d280) early-returns 1 ("yes, primary") at 0x81d2a8 when the render
 * singleton pointer is null, so nothing is ever skipped and all three foreign
 * formats are counted as missing. (That the null singleton is the concrete
 * reason is inference from the code, not something instrumented at runtime -
 * what is measured is that no entry is skipped.)
 *
 * The consequence is not a slow download, it is a permanent freeze:
 * OnUpdate (0x3276b8) sees a non-zero queued download size, asks for Wi-Fi,
 * gets none, and calls ShowNoWifiMessage (0x323534), which sets
 * CC_AssetManager+0x8d = 1 - the byte OnUpdate tests at its first instruction.
 * See jni/classes/rr3_Platform.cpp for the other half of that story.
 *
 * The fix here is to make SkipAsset answer the question the port can answer
 * exactly: "is this file actually on the card?" Anything not present is skipped
 * from the accounting, so the download queue comes out empty, no Wi-Fi gate is
 * reached, and the asset lists complete into OnAssetListsComplete (0x3272a8) ->
 * OnDownloadingComplete (0x320e20).
 *
 * Why file-existence and not a blanket "skip everything": a blanket skip also
 * empties the list of assets the game knows it has, and LoadAssetList's output
 * is more than a counter. Existence-based skipping keeps every entry the donor
 * can actually serve and drops exactly the ones that would be download work.
 *
 * Why this is safe to hook at all: SkipAsset has exactly three references in
 * the binary - the thunk at 0x322efc (a plain `b` to the impl), the Thn20
 * adjustor at 0x322f00, and one vtable slot in .data.rel.ro at 0xa7162c - and
 * the only caller is LoadAssetList. It takes no part in loading an asset.
