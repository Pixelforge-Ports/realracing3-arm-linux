/*
 * The audio pump: the Java thread libfmodex.so is waiting for.
 *
 * Real Racing 3 plays everything through FMOD Ex, and FMOD Ex on Android does
 * not own its own playback thread. Its AudioTrack output only mixes when
 * somebody calls it, and on a phone that somebody is Java:
 * org.fmod.FMODAudioDevice runs a thread that asks the native side for the
 * format, hands it a direct ByteBuffer to fill, and writes the result to an
 * android.media.AudioTrack. The game's own AudioStreamManager owns that object.
 *
 * A loader with no JVM never runs any of it. FMOD came up, the engine loaded
 * its banks, the mixer was ready - and nothing ever asked it for a single
 * sample. The port reached the driving tutorial in complete silence with no
 * error anywhere in the log, because from FMOD's point of view nothing had
 * gone wrong. It was still waiting to be asked.
 *
 * So this file is that thread, in C++. libfmodex.so exports exactly the two
 * entry points the Java class calls, and nothing else about it is Java-shaped:
 *
 *   jint fmodGetInfo(JNIEnv*, jobject, jint what)
 *   jint fmodProcess(JNIEnv*, jobject, jobject directByteBuffer)
 *
 * Both were read out of the donor's disassembly rather than guessed, because
 * the wrong buffer size here is not a build error - it is noise, or a stutter
 * that reads like a performance problem. What the disassembly settled:
 *
 *   - fmodGetInfo ignores env and thiz entirely; only the third argument is
 *     used. It answers a five-entry jump table and returns -1 for anything
 *     else, and for every code while the output is not yet initialised:
 *
 *         0  sample rate
 *         1  DSP buffer length, in FRAMES
 *         2  number of buffers
 *         3  the constant 1
 *         4  channel count
 *
 *   - fmodProcess calls exactly one JNIEnv function, GetDirectBufferAddress,
 *     and writes bufferLength * channels samples of interleaved PCM16 there.
 *     It never asks the buffer how big it is, so the buffer we hand over must
 *     be at least that large - FMOD will write that much regardless.
 *
 * The -1 is what makes the start-up order a non-problem: the pump can be
 * started before the game has created its FMOD system, and simply waits until
 * the answers become real. That is also this file's diagnostic value. If the
 * config never arrives, FMOD did not choose the AudioTrack output at all, and
 * the log says so instead of leaving another silent run to interpret.
