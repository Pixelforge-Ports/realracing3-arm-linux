/*
 * The import tables the bionic ELF loader binds into librealracing3.so.
 *
 * The game's dynamic table lists nine shared objects: libandroid, libEGL,
 * libGLESv2, libOpenSLES, liblog, libm, libstdc++, libdl and libc. None of
 * them exist on the R36S in a form an Android .so can link against, so each
 * one is answered here by a table of host functions.
 *
 * so_resolve_link() walks these in order and takes the first match, which is
 * why the port's own tables come before the generic bionic libc one.
 *
 * A symbol that is in none of them stays unresolved. The loader points it at a
 * PLT stub that aborts on first call, and src/main.cpp reports it by name
 * before anything runs - see report_unresolved_symbols().
