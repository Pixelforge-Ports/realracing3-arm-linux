/*
 * Shader compilation probe.
 *
 * M4's criterion is "the EGL context is current and the game's shaders
 * compile". The loader cannot answer that by inspection: the engine compiles
 * its shaders from its own thread, checks the status itself, and says nothing
 * on stderr when one fails - it just draws nothing afterwards, which looks
 * exactly like a working port with a black frame.
 *
 * So glCompileShader and glLinkProgram are intercepted. Each call is forwarded
 * to the real driver entry point and the status is read back; a failure is
 * printed with the driver's info log, and the counts are what the loader waits
 * on before it is willing to claim GL is up.
 *
 * This is observation, not emulation: the driver does the work and its verdict
 * is reported verbatim. A shader that does not compile makes the milestone
 * fail, which is the point.
 *
 * The table below is listed before both GL tables in so_dynamic_libraries, so
 * the game binds these instead of the raw entry points. Shader calls forward
 * through the GLES2 glad globals. Draw calls must select the live GLES1 table:
 * this fixed-function game never initialises the separate GLES2 glad globals.

 * The largest DXT3/DXT5 worth expanding to RGBA8888, and what happens above it.

 * port already decodes on every run - measured at 93.8 Mpx/s for DXT3 against
 * 107.2 Mpx/s for DXT1, i.e. the same work per texel. What it costs is *memory*,
 * and that is what stopped the level load:
 *
 *   DXT1  0.5 bytes/texel -> RGBA8888 is 8x
 *   DXT3  1.0 bytes/texel -> RGBA8888 is 4x
 *
 * Before this decoder existed the Mali rejected every DXT3 upload and allocated
 * nothing for it. Now each one is a real allocation, and the eight largest are
 * 2048x2048 - 21.3 MiB apiece with their mip chains. They are not effects:
 * texture_env_desertplanet_platform, _skydome_02, _beacon, snow_planet_05_lm,
 * medical_bay_*_prop_set_02, moonbase_sky_nebula_01, cerberusprison_turret.
 * World surfaces - which is why the floor was untextured, and why texturing it
 * is what stopped the level fitting.
 *
 * Measured over the environment set of the landing level, resident RGBA bytes:
 *
 *   DXT1 alone (the build that plays)           165.3 MiB
 *   + DXT3 at RGBA8888 (the build that hangs)   237.3 MiB   +43%
 *   + DXT3 capped, big ones as RGBA4444         205.3 MiB   +24%
 *   + DXT3 capped, big ones left to the driver  173.3 MiB    +5%
 *
 * So the default caps at 1024. Every effect and particle texture in the game
 * fits under it - that whole set tops out at 1024 - so they all keep full
 * quality, and the eight big world textures stay exactly as the playable build
 * had them. The RGBA4444 path for those is implemented and one environment
 * variable away, because +24% on a budget that broke at +43% is a coin flip and

 * The rest of the pipeline, observed on the way past.
 *
 * These wrappers exist for the 3D-scene investigation and do nothing but count.
 * Each one forwards through resolve_gl_entry(), which reproduces the table
 * order the game would have resolved without the interposition, and each one
 * reports a null pointer instead of returning quietly - the failure mode this
 * project has already paid for is a wrapper that silently declines to call the
 * driver, and it has to be impossible to repeat without noticing.
 *
 * None of these signatures carries a float, so THUNK_SPECIFIC hands the game
 * the pointer directly and no softfp/hardfp bridge is involved.
