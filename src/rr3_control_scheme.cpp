/*
 * Boot a gamepad-only device into a control scheme the game itself offers.
 *
 * Real Racing 3 on Android defaults to ControlMethods_e 0, "Tilt A", because
 * every phone has an accelerometer. An R36S does not, and the engine tells the
 * player so on every controller connect: "Note: Tilt A (default) control scheme
 * still active". That note comes from CGlobal::scene_ProcessConnectedJoysticks
 * (0x43f748) and is printed whenever game_GetCurrentControlMethod() <= 7.
 *
 * What the scheme actually decides, measured in the donor binary:
 *
 *   Car::CalculateJoystickSteeringAngles (0x33ad38) takes the steering angle
 *   from JoystickInput::getSteering() for every scheme once a pad is present,
 *   so steering is not the problem.
 *
 *   Car::ReadPlayerAccelerationInput (0x33b104..0x33b14c) is the one that
 *   changes: schemes 6, 0 and 5 each store a literal 1.0 - the game drives the
 *   throttle for you - and every other scheme reads
 *   JoystickInput::getAcceleration(), i.e. the pad's own trigger.
 *
 * Scheme 7 (Wheel_Manual, "Wheel B") is the only entry the game's own Controls
 * menu offers that both takes steering from the stick through the explicit
 * 0xE0-mask branch and leaves the throttle to the player. That is the scheme a
 * gamepad wants, so that is what a fresh install is seeded with.
 *
 * Why writing the file is not "patching":
 *
 *   SaveManager::SavePlayerProfile (0x922e3c) is literally
 *   "PlayerProfile::InitFromGlobalSettings(); AssetSaveFile(name, buf, 124)" -
 *   a raw 124-byte dump with no header, no checksum and no encryption, and
 *   SaveManager::LoadPlayerProfile (0x922ef4) memcpy()s it straight back over
 *   the defaults. PlayerProfile::InitGlobalSettings (0x419e84) then does
 *
 *       ldr r1, [r4, #20] ; cmp r1, #7 ; movhi r1, #0 ; strhi r1, [r4, #20]
 *       b   game_SetControlMethod
 *
 *   so offset 20 is the ControlMethods_e (clamped to 0..7, which is why 8 is
 *   not reachable this way and does not matter - 8 is RuleSet_DragRace's
 *   per-mode override, not a pad scheme) and it reaches exactly the same
 *   CGlobal::game_SetControlMethod that FrontEnd2::ControlsMenu::
 *   OnSetControlMethod calls. Offset 24 is the "flipped" flag (CGlobal+0x43dc).
 *
 * Seeded once and never again: the marker file below is what makes the
 * player's own choice in the Controls menu survive the next launch. The
 * game's menu remains the canonical way to change this; this only decides
 * what a first boot starts from.
 *
 * REALRACING3_CONTROL_METHOD=N (0..7) forces a re-seed, for A/B runs.
