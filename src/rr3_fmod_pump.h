 * AudioTrack if it is not, and only initialises the one it picked. So the
 * decision is expressed in the one place FMOD asks - dlopen_impl - and the
 * pump reads the same answer to know whether it has anything to do. Running
 * both would not be belt and braces; the pump would spin forever against an
 * output that was never created.
 *
 * REALRACING3_FMOD_OUTPUT=audiotrack switches to the pump. Default is OpenSL,
