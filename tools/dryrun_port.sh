# Dry run of the PortMaster launcher, inside the build container.
#
# M7's done_when is "validated by shellcheck and a dry run". This is the dry
# run: it builds a throwaway PortMaster installation around ports/Real Racing 3.sh
# and executes the real script — no copy, no edited variant — so that the
# things only the launcher can get wrong are actually exercised:
#
#   * the controlfolder probe finds control.txt
#   * "/$directory/ports/realracing3" resolves to where the port was installed
#   * cd, the log.txt redirect and mkdir of REALRACING3_DATA_DIR all succeed
#   * $GPTOKEYB is backgrounded and $TASKSET starts the game with the APK
#   * pm_finish runs and gptokeyb is gone afterwards
#   * libs.armhf/ really does carry every library the console will not have
#
# That last one is the only claim a dry run inside the build image could fake,
# because the image has all those libraries installed system-wide: the game
# would start with an empty libs.armhf and prove nothing. So before the run,
# every library the port bundles is moved out of the image's own search paths
# (the container is a throwaway, so this destroys nothing). What is left is a
# machine that has glibc and SDL2 and nothing else of ours — which is the
# console. If libs.armhf is missing one entry, the game does not start.
#
# The two substitutions the container forces, both of the same shape the real
# thing has: $TASKSET becomes qemu-arm (a command prefix, like taskset -c) and
# $GPTOKEYB becomes a script that sleeps (a backgrounded daemon, like the real
# one). Everything else is the port as it will ship.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, on the host):

# away every other armhf library in the image. Deriving the list from

# missing from libs.armhf was also missing from the removal list, so the
# system copy answered and the dry run passed with an incomplete port.
# The GL stack is not reachable by DT_NEEDED: glvnd dlopens its vendor library
# (libEGL_mesa) and mesa dlopens its driver out of dri/, so both have to be
# named. In emulation that stack is Mesa; on the console it is the Mali blob.
# Either way it belongs to the device, and so does everything it drags in —
# which is the one soft spot of this removal: a library Mesa happens to need
# too (libz, libzstd) survives here and is proven only by assertion 1 above.
