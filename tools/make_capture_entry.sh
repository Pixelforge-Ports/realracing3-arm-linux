# Build a throwaway Ports entry that plays the game and screenshots itself.
#
# The release needs a screenshot of the game actually running, and getting one
# off this hardware is awkward: PortMaster's own tool uses ffmpeg's kmsgrab,
# which wants CAP_SYS_ADMIN, and a port launcher runs as an ordinary user. So
# it fails with "No handle set on framebuffer" and there is no screenshot.
#
# Reading /dev/fb0 needs no privileges at all. This wraps the normal launcher
# and, in the background, dumps the framebuffer a few times while the game is
# up. Several shots rather than one because nobody is watching the screen to
# decide when the good frame is - it is cheaper to take four and pick later.
#
# Usage:  tools/make_capture_entry.sh <destination ports/ directory>
