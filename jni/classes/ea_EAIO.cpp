/*
 * EAIO.Startup - forwarded to the game's own native implementation.
 *
 * This is the first thing NativeOnDrawFrame does, and until this class existed
 * it was also where the port died. The sequence, read out of the disassembly
 * at 0x2367dc rather than guessed:
 *
 *     ldr pc, [r3, #24]       -> JNIEnv slot 6   = FindClass("com/ea/EAIO/EAIO")
 *     ldr pc, [ip, #0x1c4]    -> JNIEnv slot 113 = GetStaticMethodID("Startup",
 *                                "(Landroid/content/res/AssetManager;)V")
 *     ...                        then it calls what it got back
 *
 * FindClass returns NULL for a class nobody registered, GetStaticMethodID then
 * returns NULL *without warning* because its own diagnostic is guarded on a
 * non-NULL class, and the engine calls straight through it. The result is a
 * SIGSEGV with pc = 0 and a link register pointing into this loader rather than
 * into the game, which reads like a bug in our code and is not one - it is a
 * class that was never there.
 *
 * The forward is the whole implementation, and deliberately so. On Android this
 * method is declared native: there is no Java behind it to emulate, only a
 * different way of reaching code that is already in the .so we mapped. Writing
 * a plausible-looking stub here instead would leave the engine's I/O layer
 * uninitialised and fail later, somewhere with no evidence attached.
 *
 * The AssetManager argument is passed through untouched. This game never calls
 * AAssetManager_open - it does not import libandroid at all - so what arrives
 * is whatever the engine handed us, and it only has to survive the round trip.
