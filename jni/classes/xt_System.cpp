 * xt::java::getDeviceInfo() (0x985e0) takes this string, replaces every '\n'
 * with ':', splits on ':' and then copies nine of the resulting tokens into
 * its DeviceInfo *without checking how many there are*. Too few tokens is an
 * out-of-bounds read of the array followed by strlen() on whatever the length
 * word happened to be - which is exactly how the first version of this file
 * crashed the game.
 *
 * The tokens it takes are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 - the array is
 * addressed at offsets 32, 96, 160 ... 544 with an xt::String stride of 32, so
 * it reads every *second* one. That is the shape of "Label: value" lines: with
 * the newlines turned into colons, the even tokens are the labels and the odd
 * tokens are the values, and the engine keeps the values. So this must emit
 * label/value pairs, at least nine of them, and no value may contain a ':' or
 * a newline of its own or every field after it shifts by one.
 *
 * The only consumer is getDeviceId(), which matches the values against the
 * handsets the engine knows and otherwise logs "Unknown device! Assuming
 * generic Android." - which is the correct answer for an R36S, so the point of
 * this is to describe the real machine rather than to impersonate a phone.
