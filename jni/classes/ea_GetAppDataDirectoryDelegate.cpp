/*
 * The engine's data root.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How this one announced itself
 *
 * After the semaphore fix the run got as far as reading EAMCore.ini and then
 * died at text+0x31e5a8 with a null dereference. `qemu-arm -strace` showed the
 * two syscalls immediately before it:
 *
 *     openat("/game/assets/EAMCore.ini", O_RDONLY) = 5
 *     read(5, ..., 10000) = 3119
 *     close(5)
 *     statx(AT_FDCWD, "(nil)/published/var", ...) = -1 ENOENT
 *     statx(AT_FDCWD, "(nil)/published/var", ...) = -1 ENOENT
 *     --- SIGSEGV
 *
 * "(nil)" is bionic's printf rendering a NULL %s. The engine had built its
 * data root by formatting the string these methods return, got NULL, and
 * carried the literal four characters into every path after it. The crash two
 * instructions later is the filesystem module's lazy-create returning NULL and
 * being dereferenced at once (+0x31e5a4: mov r0,r7 / ldr r3,[r7]) - a
 * consequence, not the defect.
 *
 * The class was not in the "no fake class registered" list in the log, which
 * is worth saying because it is the reason this took a syscall trace rather
 * than a grep: FindClass is only reached the first time a lookup happens, and
 * the engine resolves this one lazily, after the point where the previous
 * iteration's run had already stopped.
 *
 * The names are read out of the binary, at .rodata 0x3dacd8..0x3dad20:
 * "com/ea/blast/GetAppDataDirectoryDelegate", "GetAppDataDirectory",
 * "GetExternalStorageDirectory". The vita loader lists the same two methods as
 * ids 107 and 108 in jni_specific.h.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the game directory, and not a writable directory
 *
 * The obvious answer is "somewhere we can write", since the first thing the
 * engine does with the root is look for published/var, which is save data.
 * That is wrong here: the same root is what every asset path is built from,
 * and the assets are the 300 MB tree the player supplies. Pointing the root at
 * scratch space would fix the save probe and break everything else.
 *
 * So the root is the game directory, exactly as the Vita port does it - its
 * fix_path() rewrites "realracing3/published" into "realracing3/assets/published"
 * precisely because its root is the game directory too and the published tree
 * sits one level deeper than the engine believes. src/symtab_io.cpp does the
 * same rewrite, generalised to whatever argv[1] is.
 *
 * Writes under a read-only game directory will fail, and that is a separate
 * problem with a separate fix (a save redirect); it is deliberately not
 * conflated with this one. What matters for now is that the root is a real
 * path instead of four characters spelling "(nil)".

/*
 * The constructor. There is nothing to construct - the delegate carries no
 * state - but it has to exist, because iface_NewObjectV refuses a class with
 * instance_size 0 and the engine calls NewObject before it calls anything
 * else.
