 * The 16-bit overload, which this engine is the first to ask for.
 *
 * AudioTrack.write has a byte[] form and a short[] form, and Android treats the
 * count argument differently in each: bytes for one, *samples* for the other.
 * Real Racing 3 uses the short[] form - the run log said so the moment the audio
 * core came up:
 *
 *     Class AudioClass does not have method write([SII)I
 *
 * and a missing method here is not a silent no-op. GetMethodID returns NULL, the
 * engine writes into nothing, and the mixer either stalls waiting for the queue
 * to drain or spins feeding a device that never consumes.
 *
 * The conversion is the whole point of a separate entry rather than an alias:
 * SDL_QueueAudio counts bytes, so the sample count doubles. Registering this
 * signature against the byte[] implementation would have queued half the audio
 * and produced a stutter that sounds like a performance problem.
 */
/*
 * Per-write signal metrics plus a running digest of every sample the mixer has
 * produced.
 *
 * The digest is what makes the VFP short-vector expansion testable. qemu-arm
 * still implements FPSCR LEN/STRIDE, so the same mixer can be run twice - once
 * with the trampolines installed and once with REALRACING3_NO_VFP_PATCH=1 - and
 * the two digests must agree exactly. That turns "the scalar expansion is
 * arithmetically equivalent" from a claim about hand-decoded opcodes into a
 * comparison the harness can make, on a machine that has no ARMv8 handheld
 * attached.
 *
 * Reported at a fixed set of write indices rather than a time interval,
 * because the comparison only means something if both runs report after the
 * same number of samples.
