 * The accessor whose absence killed the process.
 *
 * It is not in the game's PLT, so reading the import table says the game never
 * calls it - the conclusion this port shipped with, and it was wrong. The name
 * is in the binary as a string, and so is dlsym: getAxisValue arrived in API 9
 * and getHistoricalAxisValue in API 13, later than the minimum this 2013 build
 * targets, so the engine looks them up at runtime and caches the pointers in a
 * table. That is the ordinary NDK pattern for an API that might be missing.
 *
 * Our dlsym answers out of the same symbol tables the loader links against, so
 * a name absent from them silently returns NULL - and the game does not check.
 * The first time a stick moved:
 *
 *     34324: cmp  r8, r3        ; is this event AINPUT_SOURCE_JOYSTICK?
 *     34330: ldr  r3, [r6, #4]  ; the cached getAxisValue pointer
 *     3433c: blx  r3            ; NULL. pc = 0, SIGSEGV.
 *
 * Registering these two in symtable_android is the whole fix: dlsym finds
 * them, the table holds real pointers, and the call lands somewhere.
 *
 * X and Y defer to the pointer-indexed arrays so that a touch event - where
 * each finger has its own coordinates - keeps answering per pointer. Every
 * other axis belongs to the device as a whole, so the pointer index only has
 * to be in range.
