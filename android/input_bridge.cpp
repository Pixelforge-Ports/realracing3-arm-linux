/*
 * SDL controller input -> the JNI entry points exported by Real Racing 3.
 *
 * This game is a Java-driven Android application, not NativeActivity. It has
 * no AInputQueue/ALooper imports; its Android layer calls
 * KeyboardAndroid.NativeOnKey* and TouchSurfaceAndroid.NativeOnPointerEvent.
 * Feeding the native_app_glue queue therefore looks plausible but is dead
 * code for this binary. The working Vita port calls these same exports, with
 * the signatures and module IDs copied below.
 *
 * Digital mapping follows that reference exactly. Analog movement does not go
 * through the touchscreen at all: the sticks are delivered to the game's own
 * ControllerManager entry points. The virtual
 * touch drags remain available behind REALRACING3_STICK_TOUCH=1, and the menu
 * cursor keeps its own pointer events either way.
 *
 * REALRACING3_AUTOPILOT is separate from normal controls. It presses a varied
 * sequence of keys after startup and samples a framebuffer strip before each
 * swap. A scene is counted only when a substantial visual change occurs in a
 * short window after a synthetic key, rather than counting animation as proof
 * that input worked.

 * The synthetic aim tap, now opt-in: REALRACING3_AIM_TAP=1.

 *
 *   - Playable::AllowTapToAim (+0x1f5cb4) is `Settings[101] != 0 || the
 *     weapon's own force flag`, and it gates the enemy's *target state*, not
 *     the tap. With tap-to-aim off and an ordinary weapon no enemy ever reaches
 *     TargetState 4, which is the only state Interactive::OnEvent dispatches to
 *     TryTapToAim. The tap cannot enter aim in that mode at all - it is not a
 *     matter of hitting the right coordinate.
 *   - What the player aims with in that mode is the right stick: the crosshair
 *     is fixed at the centre of the screen and the stick turns the character
 *     under it. There is no aim state to enter.
 *   - Meanwhile Playable::OnEventSingleTap (+0x2074e0) - which is the *exit*
 *     handler, not the entry one - gave the tap two side effects worth being
 *     rid of: with the weapon holstered it fires Hud::TriggerNavAid(), and
 *     during the "fire_hold" rig state it calls Playable::AbortFire(), i.e. it
 *     cancelled the player's own shot.
 *
 * So L2 falls through to the shoulder button above it, the way R2 already
 * doubles R1: L1/L2 cover and slide, R1/R2 fire, right stick aims. The tap
 * stays behind the flag for the day someone wants to support the game's own

/*
 * Aiming, which is a touch gesture and has no key.
 *
 * The gameplay key switch, Hud::onKeyDown (+0x118bdc), does contain one aim
 * path - BUTTON_L1 while standing still runs Playable::TryTapToAim over every
 * Interactive in the world - but it is behind a weapon gate:
 *
 *     11a46c: if (Weapon::GetWeaponTag(weapon) != "weapon_sniper") goto 11a658
 *
 * With any other weapon that branch only raises a notice. So the sniper aims
 * from a key and nothing else does, which is what the hardware test found.
 *
 * The general path is touch, and it is a hit test rather than a region.
 * Interactive::OnEvent (+0x174a80), on a single tap:
 *
 *     if (this[0xcc] != ev[0x10]) return 0            ; the DOWN's pointer id
 *     if (!InputRegionList::IsPointWithinScaled(this+8, ev[8], ev[12], 1.5f))
 *         return 0
 *     switch (this[0x78] - 1) {
 *         0 -> Playable::TryInteract()      2 -> Playable::TryMelee()
 *         1 -> Hud::OnBioticSelect()        3 -> Playable::TryTapToAim()   <- aim
 *     }
 *
 * Every enemy carries its own projected screen hitbox at Interactive+8 and the
 * tap is tested against it scaled by 1.5 (the float is a global, GOT +0xa816a4
 * -> +0xa8370c, read out of the binary as 1.5). There is no "aim region": the
 * tap has to land on the enemy, with that much finger tolerance.
 *
 * Where to tap is not a guess either. Hud::GetCrosshairPos (+0x10f90c) is
 * eleven instructions and returns w*0.5, h*0.5 - the crosshair is the fixed
 * centre of the screen. So the button taps the centre, and the player brings
 * the enemy under it with the right stick, which already drives the camera.
 * This is not auto-target: with no enemy under the crosshair, nothing happens.
 *
 * Leaving aim is a tap on the left half. The split comes from
 * InputSchemeBasic::UpdateRegions (+0x123f2c), whose left region is
 * (0, 0, 0.55*w, h) - the 0.55 is a config float in the GOT, and 0.45/0.55 are
 * the only two values it takes.
 *
 * HOLD, AND WHY IT IS NOT A HELD POINTER.
 *
 * The button is hold-to-aim: press to aim, release to come out. The obvious
 * implementation - keep the pointer DOWN for as long as the trigger is held -
 * does not work, and InputForwarderTaps says so in two measured numbers:
 *
 *   - it tracks 12 pointer slots (the OnUpdateEvent loop runs r5 = 0..11 over
 *     28-byte entries), so the id has to be under 12;
 *   - a press held longer than 500 ms stops being a single tap (the global at
 *     +0xa838ac, read out of the binary as 500). Past that it becomes
 *     PointerEvent<1004> SingleHoldTap, and Playable::OnEventSingleTap only
 *     handles <1002>. A held pointer would aim at nothing.
 *
 * So a hold is two short taps, not one long press: centre on the way in, left
 * half on the way out. That is the shape InputForwarderTaps actually emits.
 *
 * The engine also defers the tap - the single finger event goes out on a timer
 * after the UP - so the bridge releases and lets it run. Which means a press
 * and release faster than one tap would overlap; hence the one-deep queue.

 * |axis| over 0.1, 0.4 and 0.9, per sign, per axis - is guarded by the delta
 * against the previous call, which it stores at the end:
 *
 *     Hud+0x4b4 = rx ; Hud+0x4b8 = ry     (epilogue, +0x10e8e0)
 *     if ((ry - Hud[0x4b8]) < 0) { Hud[0x4a9] = 1; Hud[0x4b0] = -speed; }
 *
 * So the camera only turns while the value keeps growing. It is written for a
 * finger dragging across glass, where every sample is further along than the
 * last. A stick held at the rail reports the same number every frame, the delta
 * is exactly zero, and the camera does not move. Hud::movePlayer (+0x10f058)
 * has no such test - it writes the movement vector straight into Playable+0x400
 * from the absolute value - which is why the left stick walks perfectly with
 * this same bridge and the right one does not.
 *
 * It also explains the shape of the hardware report: horizontal worked because
 * a thumb rolling left and right keeps producing new values, while vertical
 * "shook but did not move" because SDL pinned it at exactly -1.000 / 1.000 -
 * a stream of zero deltas, with the shake coming from the odd frame that
 * happened to differ.
 *
 * The fix is to hand the engine the ramp it is looking for. A held axis is sent
 * as a three-frame cycle of 0.94, 0.97 and 1.00 of its value, so two frames out
 * of three carry a delta with the right sign and the third is ignored by every
 * band. The multipliers are proportional on purpose: they keep the sample
 * inside the same speed band as the real deflection, so the camera moves at the
 * speed the player asked for rather than a scaled-down one.
 *
 * Only the right stick is dithered. REALRACING3_CAMERA_NO_SWIPE=1 sends the raw
 * value instead, which is the behaviour the first hardware test had.

 * Whether this port draws a menu cursor at all - REALRACING3_NO_CURSOR=1 says no.
 *
 * The cursor exists because the menus were reached by touch on a phone and this
 * console has none: the d-pad drives a painted pointer and the accept button
 * synthesises a tap under it. It is also the only thing in the port that paints
 * into the default framebuffer behind the engine's back, which is where the
 * trail on the Mali came from.
 *
 * The player reports the menus responding to the d-pad directly, which - if it
 * holds - makes the whole mechanism redundant. THAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED. The
 * loader's original donor did route face buttons through its device-specific
 * keyboard layer, so d-pad navigation is plausible; but the menu
 * widgets may equally be listening for pointer events and nothing else, in
 * which case turning the cursor off leaves the menus unnavigable. This switch
 * is here so that question gets answered on the hardware in one run instead of
 * being argued about. Unset - the default - is byte-for-byte today's behaviour.
 *
 * Gating cursor_show() is deliberately the whole implementation. Every other
 * behaviour keys off g_cursor_visible, so refusing to raise it once makes the
 * rest follow on its own: the d-pad and the accept button stop being
 * intercepted and fall through to map_button() - AKEYCODE_DPAD_* and
 * AKEYCODE_BUTTON_A to module 600, the same path the combat buttons already
 * use - android_cursor_draw() returns early because the position query reports
 * invisible, and aiming stops being suppressed. One condition, no second
 * version of the input path to keep in step with this one.
 *
 * Known cost when it is on: android_input_cursor_set() becomes a no-op, so the
 * emulator's click/move commands (emulator/send.sh) do nothing. That is a
 * development path, not a player-facing one, and the switch is for the console.
