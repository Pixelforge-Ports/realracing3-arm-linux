# Autonomous verification harness for the Real Racing 3 port.
#
# This is what lets the loop run without a human: it builds the armhf loader,
# runs it under qemu-arm with software GLES, and decides objectively which
# milestone the port currently reaches. No console, no SD card, no eyeballs.
#
# Exit code = highest milestone passed (0 = nothing builds). The loop reads it
# to know whether the last iteration moved forward, stalled, or regressed.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this file is NOT a NativeActivity-game harness
#
# Those two are NativeActivity games: the engine imports libandroid.so, runs
# its own frame loop on its own thread, and the loader only feeds it lifecycle
# commands. Real Racing 3 is the other model entirely - it imports no libandroid,
# exports JNI_OnLoad and 68 Java_* entry points, and expects a Java layer to
# drive it frame by frame. Here that Java layer is us.
#
# So three of the old milestones asserted on facts that can never be true:
#   - ANativeActivity_onCreate: the symbol does not exist in this .so
#   - an APK to load from: the game ships as a directory tree, not a zip
#   - GLSL programs linked: this is GLES 1.1 fixed function, zero shaders
#
# A harness copied across without that adjustment does not fail loudly - it
# fails *quietly*, pinning the port at M2 forever while the loop burns
# iterations trying to satisfy a check about a different game.

# M6 says "the engine is rendering". It does not say what. A game parked in its

# assets, uploads its textures and passes M6 whole. For the harness that is
# indistinguishable from a game being played.
#
# That question costs three SD-card trips to answer on the console, and it is
# the exact failure an earlier port shipped with. So the loader takes REALRACING3_AUTOPILOT
# and injects synthetic keys, hashes a strip of the framebuffer every N frames,
# and reports each time the scene actually changed:
#   TRACE: autopilot keys=<n> scenes=<n>
#
# Bar for this port (owner's decision, 2026-08-06): M6 is the automated release
# gate; M7 is answered by playing on the real device, where a human advancing
# the menus beats a synthetic tap script. A 6/7 run with M7 short is therefore
# a PASS for release purposes - M7 stays here as free extra signal, not a gate.
#
# Why it falls short at the default budget: this game needs ~410 frames /
# ~4 minutes under qemu to reach its menu (EA splash -> one transition ->
# ~250 frames of static loading screen while the garage builds offscreen).
# Only one on-screen transition fits in 120 s. TIMEOUT=400 reaches 7/7 when
# the full signal is wanted; measured 2026-08-06.
